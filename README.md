# Drag & Drop Project

This project is a simple drag-and-drop system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to drag an image and drop it into different boxes. The boxes are highlighted when an image is dragged over them, and the image can be moved between the boxes by dropping it.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag an image and drop it into any box.
- **Visual Feedback**: Boxes are highlighted when the image is dragged over them.
- **Smooth Interaction**: The image is moved to the selected box upon dropping.

## How It Works

1. Users can drag the image from its initial position.
2. As the image is dragged over a box, the box is highlighted.
3. When the image is dropped into a box, it moves into that box.
4. The image can be moved between boxes as needed.
